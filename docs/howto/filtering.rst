Working with Glycans directly - Monomer-level
=====

In order to work with glycans beyond simple conversion, one can directly work on the atomic structure of glycans. This is possible without parsing the whole glycan into SMILES but just read in the monosaccharide tree by setting tree_only=True when instantiating a glycan.
